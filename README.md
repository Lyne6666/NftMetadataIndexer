# NftMetadataIndexer

## Description

A smart contract suite implementing a novel NFT fractionalization and dynamic rarity system using on-chain verifiable randomness and a Merkle tree-based ownership structure for gas-efficient claim mechanisms.

## Features

- Indexes NFT metadata from multiple blockchains using a configurable adapter pattern.
- Stores indexed NFT metadata in a distributed NoSQL database with configurable consistency levels.
- Provides a GraphQL API for querying NFT metadata with advanced filtering and sorting capabilities.
- Implements a caching layer with configurable TTLs to reduce database load and improve query performance.
- Employs a robust event listener architecture to detect and process new NFT mints and transfers.
- Supports custom metadata transformations using a scripting engine for normalization and enrichment.
- Exposes Prometheus metrics for monitoring system health, indexing latency, and query performance.
- Integrates with IPFS and Arweave for decentralized metadata storage and retrieval.
